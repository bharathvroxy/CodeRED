This project is for storing the data of users.
Its consists of login and register modules.

We use php, html, css, mysql

We'll need XAMPP server to run this whole operation.

Firstly, create a folder in htdocs (present in xampp folder) store all the files in it.

For the database, fire up the xampp server, then create a database user_db, create a table user_form.

user_form should consist of 5 columns, id type serial, name varchar, email varchar, password varchar, user_type user.

Then connect this to the config.php.

Open localhost/folder_name for the fun.
